First assignment, due to 01/10/2021.


### Approach 2

For the first part of the experiment, meaning the evolution part, you need to:
	-Run the approach2/neat_optmization.py file. There you can set up the ENEMIES array to change trough different enenemies.
	-The results are stored in the approach2/runs/enemy_# folder. 

For the second part, where the best individuals are confronted to different enemies, you need to:
	-run the approach2/play_with_best.py file. There can change the ENEMY parameter to face different enemies (those enemies need to have a created folder and results from the first part of the experiment)
	-results are stored in approach2/runs/enemy_#/games_played.csv
