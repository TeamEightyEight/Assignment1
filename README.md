# ðŸ§¬ Evolutionary EvoMan player - Assignment 1 ðŸŽ®

This repository contains a project realized as part of the *Evolutionary Computing* course of the Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.     
The aim of this project is compare two **Evolutionary Algorithms** for the task of video game playing using a python framework called EvoMan.
For more details, read the [task assigment](standard_assignment_taskI.pdf).
The proposed solution is describer in the [report](report/report.pdf).

### Approach 1

For the first part of the experiment, meaning the evolution part, you need to:
- Run the `approach1/genetic_optimization.py` file. There you can set up the ENEMY global variable to change through different enemies. 
- The best individual found  is stored in the `approach1/runs/enemy_#/best_individual_run_#.txt` file. The history of the evolution is stored in the `approach1/runs/enemy_#/logbook_run_#.csv` file.
- The `hyperparameter_tuning.py` file is used to tune the hyperparameters of the algorithm through hyperopt 
- `approach1/experiment_runner.py` runs 10 optimizations simultaneously.
  
For the second part, where the best individuals are confronted to different enemies, you need to:
- Run the `approach1/play_with_best.py` file, selecting the enemy you want to play with. 
- Results are then stored in the `approach1/runs/enemy_#/games_played.csv` file.

### Approach 2

For the first part of the experiment, meaning the evolution part, you need to:
- Run the `approach2/neat_optmization.py` file. There you can set up the ENEMIES global variable to change through different enemies.
- The best individual found  is stored in the `approach2/runs/enemy_#/best_individual_run_#.txt` file. The history of the evolution is stored in the `approach2/runs/enemy_#/logbook_run_#.csv` file.

For the second part, where the best individuals are confronted to different enemies, you need to: 
- Run the `approach2/play_with_best.py` file. There can change the ENEMY parameter to face different enemies (those enemies need to have a created folder and results from the first part of the experiment) 
- Results are stored in the `approach2/runs/enemy_#/games_played.csv` file.

### Results
Results obtained with both approach show that even in the early generations we can obtain very good individuals, reaching fitness  values above 90 for all three enemies tested.
